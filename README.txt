I ran this on vscode with code runner so I just pressed 1 button but just incase I'll leave the cmd line code here (node "c:\Users\thuan\Downloads\winter 2022\comp 2150\javascript\HuffmanEncoding.js") FILE PATH DOES NOT APPLY TO YOUR COMPUTER I THINK.

-To create a huffmanEncoding for any file, create a HuffmanEncoding object with the txt file name and it should append the result to output.txt in the same directory.
-Make sure the file is in the same directory as the huffmanEncoding as I coded it so and it should print it to output.txt, output is only the final Huffman Encoding with format "characters:code anothercharacter:anothercode". 
-I've also removed all linebreaks so it doesn't count towards the huffman code because requirements are "Do not output any
newline symbols, except for one at the end".
-Another note is that I only use appendFileSync so you need to manually clear it or add some code that clear the output file after each run as I'd make grading and reading output easier.
